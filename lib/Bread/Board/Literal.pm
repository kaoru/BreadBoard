=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<service|Bread::Board::Service> class implements literal
services. A literal service is constructed with a value, and it always
returns that when asked for an instance.

=attr C<value>

Required attribute with read/write accessor. This is the value that
L</get> will return.

=method C<get>

Returns the L</value>, unaltered.

=method C<clone_and_inherit_params>

Dies: a literal service is (essentially) a constant, it does not make
sense to inherit from it.
