=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used when L<resolving dependencies that need
parameters|Bread::Board::Service::WithDependencies/resolve_dependencies>.

Since the service needs parameters to instantiate its value, and no
values were provided for those parameters, the best we can do is use a
coderef that will accept the parameters and call C<get> on the
service.

=method C<inflate>

  my $service_value = $deferred_thunk->inflate(%service_parameters);

This will call C<get> on the service, passing it all the
C<%service_parameters>. Normal parameter validation and service
lifecycle apply.
