=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a sub-role of L<Bread::Board::Service>, for services with
dependencies. It provides the mechanism to recursively resolve
dependencies.

=attr C<dependencies>

Hashref, constrained by L<<
C<Bread::Board::Service::Dependencies>|Bread::Board::Types/Bread::Board::Service::Dependencies
>>. Values must be instances of L<Bread::Board::Dependency>, but can
be coerced from various other types, see L<the type's
docs|Bread::Board::Types/Bread::Board::Service::Dependencies>.

=method C<add_dependency>

  $service->add_dependency(name=>$dep);

Adds a new dependency.

=method C<get_dependency>

  my $dep = $service->get_dependency('name');

Gets a dependency by name.

=method C<has_dependency>

  if ($service->has_dependency('name')) { ... }

Returns true if this service has a dependency with the given name.

=method C<has_dependencies>

  if ($service->has_dependencies) { ... }

Returns true if this service has any dependency.

=method C<get_all_dependencies>

  my %deps = $service->get_all_dependencies;

Returns all the dependencies for this service, as a key-value list.

=method C<init_params>

Builder for the service parameters, augmented to inject all the
L<resolved dependencies|/resolve_dependencies> into the L<<
C<params>|Bread::Board::Service/params >> attribute, so that C<get>
can use them.

=method C<get>

I<After> the C<get> method, the L<<
C<params>|Bread::Board::Service/params >> attribute is cleared, to
make sure that dependencies will be resolved again on the next call (of
course, if the service is using a L<singleton
lifecycle|Bread::Board::LifeCycle::Singleton>, the whole "getting"
only happens once).

=method C<resolve_dependencies>

  my %name_object_map = $self->resolve_dependencies;

For each element of L</dependencies>, calls its L<<
C<service>|Bread::Board::Dependency/service >> method to retrieve the
service we're dependent on, then tries to instantiate the value of the
service. This can happen in a few different ways:

=begin :list

= the service is not locked, and does not require any parameter

just call C<get> on it

= the service is not locked, requires parameters, but the dependency has values for them

call C<< $service->get(%{$dependency->service_params}) >>

= the service is not locked, requires parameters, and we don't have values for them

we can't instantiate anything at this point, so we use a
L<Bread::Board::Service::Deferred::Thunk> instance, on which you can
call the C<inflate> method, passing it all the needed parameters, to
get the actual instance

= the service is locked

we return a L<Bread::Board::Service::Deferred> that will proxy to the
instance that the service will eventually return; yes, this means that
in many cases circular dependencies can be resolved, at the cost of a
proxy object

=end :list
