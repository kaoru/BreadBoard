When L<creating|Bread::Board::Container::Parameterized/create (
%params )> an actual container from a L<parameterized
container|Bread::Board::Container::Parameterized>, the returned
container is re-blessed into this class.

The only difference between this class and L<Bread::Board::Container>
is that the C<parent> attribute here is a weak reference.
