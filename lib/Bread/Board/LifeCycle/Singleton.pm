=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sub-role of L<Bread::Board::LifeCycle>, this role defines the
"singleton" lifecycle for a service. The C<get> method will only do
its work the first time it is invoked; subsequent invocations will
return the same object.

=method C<get>

The first time this is called (or the first time after calling
L</flush_instance>), the actual C<get> method will be invoked, and its
return value cached in the L</instance> attribute. The value of that
attribute will always be returned, so you can call C<get> as many time
as you need, and always receive the same instance.

=attr C<instance>

The object build by the last call to C<get> to actually do any work,
and returned by any subsequent call to C<get>.

=method C<has_instance>

Predicate for the L</instance> attribute.

=method C<flush_instance>

Clearer for the L</instance> attribute. Clearing the attribute will
cause the next call to C<get> to instantiate a new object.
